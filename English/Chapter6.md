# 6. Summary

Let’s wrap up. Through this tutorial, we’ve learned theoretically about what Klaytn is, and we’ve used Klaytn’s tools: wallet, ide, and scope. And we’ve developed a simple addition game BApp through caver.js. 1-sec finality can be noticed while we create a transaction. It's a huge advantage. The service chain is not yet under development, but if you are wondering, go to Klaytn’s official documentation website, and experiment and try it by yourself.

This is Klaytn’s official document. Although it is in English, you can check out more information. For example, if you have more questions about the caver.js api, check the toolkit api caver.js in the api tab. And the tutorials tab gives you templates for creating ReAct versions of BApp. Reactors can learn more by following the tutorial. Finally, ask the Klaytn community for questions about the lecture and other questions. You can fill it out in Facebook Klaytn Group or Reddit. I'll give you a link in the course.

We hope that the blockchain community will become more active and popularized through the Klaytn blockchain platform of Kakao. Thank you.
